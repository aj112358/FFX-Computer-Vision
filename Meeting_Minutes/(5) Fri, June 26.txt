++++++++++ Friday, June 26, 2020 @8:00pm (30 mins) on Zoom ++++++++++


Lucas shared his updates:
	- Showed and explained current version of OpenCV Python code
		- Takes color video as input
		- Turns it to grayscael
		- Currently prints average of grayscale intensity values
			- Averages over entire webcam field-of-vies


AJ shared his updates:
	- Currently having trouble making I2C connection
	- Needs to confirm the webcam can be connected to Rpi4


Potential issues:
	- May need to modify Python program a bit to work with the Arduino
		- i.e. Modify OpenCV outputs to be more easily read by Arduino
	- Will need to test if webcam/OpenCV correctly identifies RGB values from TV screen


***** NEXT MEETING *****
 -> Sat, June 27 @6pm (tentative)
 -> Will integrate hardware with software for our first test!
