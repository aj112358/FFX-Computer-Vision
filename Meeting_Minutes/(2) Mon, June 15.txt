++++++++++ Mon, June 15, 2020 @730pm (60 mins) on Zoom ++++++++++


- invited Lucas to be a collaborator on this project

- talked about some general/initial ideas
	- Do we only need to view part of the screen?
	- We shouldn't need the whole screen in the webcam frame
	- Could try zooming the webcam very close to the screen
	- Is framerate going to be an issue?

- AJ can (easily?) make a robot to press the PS4 controller button
	- Dependent on any kind of input
		- mouse click
		- keyboard input
		- LED status
		- push-button

- Lucas can (easily?) get the TV screen pixels using computer vision
	- There may be an issue with regards to how a TV screen emits light

- one major difficulty will be to connect the hardware and software together

- a possible solution to connect hardware and software:
	- AJ can interface the Rpi4 with the Arduino "easily" (i.e. it's doable)
	- We can run Python code on the Rpi4
	- So, the computer vision from Rpi4 can interact directly with the Arduino!
	- Will still need to figure out/test to make sure

- another idea:
	- Is there a way to extract the save file from the PS4??
	- Then maybe we can upload to an emulator!
	- If this works, will allow for easy testing of our program

- BUT: Not everyone is playing on an emulator
	- Will still have to try with actual camera hardware too


++++++++++ EDP STEP 1 = Define the Problem ++++++++++


- "Create a robot to solve the lightning sidequest"
	- Much too specific
	- Need to start with a more generic statement
	- ex: If a kid comes to you with this problem, they aren't likely to phrase it like this!

- after some discussion, we came up with the following:

*PROBLEM STATEMENT*: "The FFX 'Dodge 200 lightning bolts' challenge is hard and stupid and I can't do it"


++++++++++ TO-DO (Deadline = Thurs, June 18, 2020) ++++++++++


AJ
	
Lucas

Both
	- Do background research into the problem
		- Think more generally!
		- Does a solution already exist?
