## Project Summary

GOAL:

* Hello
* World

### Python Libraries Used

Python Version: 3.7
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (as chart_studio), cufflinks, datetime, scipy

Libraries for data collection: open-cv


## Data Collection

I collected data using a webcam setup with Raspberry Pi 4 & Arduino Uno, using the OpenCV Python library.

### Data Cleaning

I had to clean the data a lot. Here are some specifics:

* boom
* shaka
* laka

### Feature Engineering

The main thing I was interested in was the timing of the lightning strikes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Here is what I discovered...
